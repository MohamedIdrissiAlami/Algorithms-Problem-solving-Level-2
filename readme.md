# Algorithms & Problem Solving Level 2

This repository contains a collection of C++ exercises focused on algorithms and problem-solving, following structured programming concepts and clean code practices.

## Structure
Each exercise is organized in its own folder (e.g., `Ex-01`, `Ex-02`, ...), containing:
- A C++ source file (e.g., `Ex-01.cpp`)
- A `readme.md` file with a description of the exercise

## Goals
- Practice and improve problem-solving skills using C++
- Apply structured programming principles
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code

## How to Use
1. Browse the folders to find individual exercises.
2. Read the `readme.md` in each folder for problem statements and details.
3. Review or run the C++ code in each exercise.
